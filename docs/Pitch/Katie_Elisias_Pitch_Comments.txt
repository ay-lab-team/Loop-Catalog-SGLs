 - Solid professional 
- Katie Ellisas (T1D Fund)
- What enambles to do 
- future clinical devs 
- genetic modulators 
- emphasize so what does this technique add to field 
- tighten up 
- bucket the steps into steps 
- what did you learn 
- Written sumbission is already present so presentation can be diffreent 
- Implications are more important - Biomarker strategy 
- Show where people were wrong about some gene 
- Obesity
- Value of this framework, it'll be the right gene to study
- To study these disease we need 
	- GwAS gives us snp but NOT cell types 
	- eQTL finds targets but they might be wrong, should find 
	- CHIPseq - should find the correct target (fixes 

- Slide 1 Right cell type, gene expression
- Slide 2 GWAS (right variant but conditions are not known)
- Slide 


- Money is important (experiments are important) - Need to do more experiments 
- How do you find out what a gene does? Assay in different conditions.
